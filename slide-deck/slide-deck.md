Description
========================================================

<br>Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But **typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain**.

This is a data product that helps you **predict the next word** after a word or a phrase, based on several files with content in English.

Functionality
========================================================

<br>This app uses a **large corpus** of twitter, news and blogs data to build n-grams (continuos sequences of "n" words) and try to **predict the next most probable word** that the user will introduce.

A **sample** of the data is taken, cleaned and  processed as a character vector so it can be split into **tokens or n-grams using a back-off strategy**.

Application
========================================================

<br>Use the Word Prediction app at this link:

Just put your text in the field of the sidebar and select up to three word predictions with the slider. Easy peasy!
