## Description

Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain.

This is a data product that helps you predict the next word after a word or a phrase, based on several files with content in English.

## Functionality

This app uses a large corpus of twitter, news and blogs data to build n-grams (continuos sequences of "n" words) and try to predict the next most probable word that the user will introduce.

A sample of the data is taken, cleaned and  processed as a character vector so it can be split into **tokens or n-grams using a back-off strategy.
